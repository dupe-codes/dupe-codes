I'm Nick ([pronoun.is/he](http://pronoun.is/he))

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar until late 2020. Iâ€™m taking time off now to selfishly indulge my art practice.

My current technical obsessions are VR and game development. Both interest me as mediums for storytelling and artistic expression.

When I'm not coding, I read a bunch of books ðŸ“š and play a ton of chess â™›. I also like to draw âœŽ. A lot.
