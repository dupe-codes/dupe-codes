I'm Nick ([pronoun.is/he](http://pronoun.is/he))

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016, and have worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar ever since. Starting Fall 2020, I’ll be at Princeton pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science 🏫

My interests include the development of safe and fair artificial intelligence, the design and analysis of algorithms, and the application of both to issues of public health and environmental management. I specifically plan to use my coming time in graduate school to research machine learning interpretability and to explore ways to contribute to infectious disease research.

Outside of work, I read a bunch of books 📚 and play a ton of chess ♛. I also like to draw ✎, evidence available [@okawbae](https://www.instagram.com/okawbae/).
