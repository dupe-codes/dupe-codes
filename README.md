I'm Nick (he/him)

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar until late 2020. After a bit of time off to selfishly indulge my art practice, I worked as a senior software engineer at Attentive on the data platform team. Then I joined the team at Arena AI as a... yup, software engineer. I'm now at Numeric (as a software engineer btw), though my streak of working at companies whose names start with the letter A has finally ended. Now begins the era of the letter N.

A random sampling of my interests:

- math
- algorithms & data structures
- low-level programming (kernels, osdev, HPC)
- compilers & programming languages
- AI/ML (especially topics of interpretability & its theoretical foundations)

_disclaimer: stated interest != guarantees of aptitude_ ðŸ¤­ 

When I'm not coding, I read a bunch of books and play a ton of games ðŸŽ®. I also like to draw âœŽ. A lot.
