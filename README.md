I'm Nick (he/him)

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar until late 2020. After a bit of time off to selfishly indulge my art practice, I'm now a senior software engineer at Attentive on the data platform team.

A random sampling of my interests:

- mathematics
- algorithms & data structures
- artificial intelligence
- computer systems & systems programming
- programming languages
- video games & storytelling

_disclaimer: stated interest != guarantees of aptitude_ 🤭 

When I'm not coding, I read a bunch of books 📚 and play a ton of games 🎮. I also like to draw ✎. A lot.
