I'm Nick (he/him) 👋

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar until late 2020. After a bit of time off to selfishly indulge my art practice, I'm now a senior software engineer at Attentive on the data platform team.

My current technical obsessions are game development and streaming data platforms for analytics and machine learning. The former interests me as a medium for artistic expression and the latter as an exciting emergent technical domain. Sometime in the medium-term future, I’d like to land a gig as a research engineer.

When I'm not coding, I read a bunch of books 📚 and play a ton of games 🎮. I also like to draw ✎. A lot.
